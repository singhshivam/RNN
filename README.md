# RNN: Recurrent neural networks
A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a class of artificial neural networks where connections between nodes form a directed graph along a temporal sequence. This allows it to exhibit temporal dynamic behavior.

My first Recurrent Neural Network using Keras. This was an experiment to get myself started with in-depth machine learning.

## LSTM: Long Short Term Memory 
Long short-term memory (LSTM) is an artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture used in the field of deep learning. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, LSTM has feedback connections.
